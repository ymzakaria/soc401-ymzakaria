title: Policy Options and Recommendations
---

Seattle’s housing affordability crisis is shaped by rising rents, uneven housing production, and spatially concentrated displacement pressures. The findings from this analysis suggest that no single policy tool can fully address these challenges. Instead, policymakers must weigh the benefits and limitations of multiple approaches while considering how policies interact across neighborhoods with different risk profiles. The following options represent realistic strategies currently debated or implemented in high-cost cities, each with distinct implications for housing stability and supply.

**Option 1: Implement Targeted Rent Stabilization in High-Risk Neighborhoods**

One policy option is to implement rent stabilization measures that limit annual rent increases in neighborhoods identified as having high displacement risk, such as those classified as “Low-Income/Susceptible to Displacement,” “Ongoing Displacement,” or “Advanced Displacement.” Targeting rent stabilization to these areas would provide immediate protections to tenants who are most vulnerable to rising rents and involuntary displacement. Empirical research suggests that rent stabilization can significantly increase housing stability by reducing tenant turnover and allowing renters to remain in their homes longer, particularly in high-cost markets.

However, rent stabilization also presents limitations. Studies indicate that when implemented broadly and without complementary policies, rent regulation may discourage investment in rental housing or lead landlords to remove units from the rental market. These effects raise concerns among property owners and developers, particularly in neighborhoods where housing supply is already constrained. A targeted approach could mitigate some of these risks by limiting rent stabilization to areas with the greatest vulnerability, but enforcement and monitoring would be critical to ensure compliance and prevent unintended consequences such as deferred maintenance or tenant harassment.

**Option 2: Expand Incentives for Deeply Affordable Housing Production**

A second policy option focuses on expanding the supply of housing affordable to households earning 0–30% AMI through increased public investment, zoning incentives, and inclusionary housing requirements. The analysis shows that recent housing production in Seattle has disproportionately served moderate-income households, leaving a persistent shortage of deeply affordable units. Increasing subsidies for nonprofit developers, expanding housing levies, and strengthening requirements for affordability in new developments could help close this gap over time.

This approach directly addresses the structural mismatch between renter incomes and available housing. However, expanding deeply affordable housing supply requires sustained public funding and long implementation timelines. New units may take years to plan, finance, and construct, meaning this option alone does not provide immediate relief for households currently facing displacement. Additionally, reliance on public funding can limit the scale of production, particularly during periods of budget constraint. While essential for long-term affordability, supply-focused strategies must be paired with policies that stabilize existing renters in the short term.

**Option 3: Combine Targeted Rent Stabilization with Affordable Housing Investment**

A combined policy approach that pairs targeted rent stabilization with expanded investment in deeply affordable housing offers the most comprehensive response to Seattle’s affordability challenges. Rent stabilization can provide immediate protection for renters in high-risk neighborhoods, reducing displacement pressures while longer-term housing investments come online. At the same time, prioritizing deeply affordable housing production addresses the structural shortage identified in the analysis and helps prevent future displacement.

Although this approach requires coordination across multiple agencies and higher upfront costs, it balances short-term tenant stability with long-term market sustainability. Research suggests that rent stabilization is most effective when implemented alongside policies that expand housing supply and support nonprofit and public-sector development. By aligning tenant protections with targeted housing investment, Seattle can reduce displacement risk without significantly discouraging new construction or investment.

**Recommendation**

Based on the findings, the most effective policy response is a combined strategy that implements targeted rent stabilization in neighborhoods with high displacement risk while expanding investment in deeply affordable housing for households earning 0–30% AMI. This approach directly responds to the spatial concentration of vulnerability identified in the displacement map and addresses the persistent affordability gaps revealed in the time-series analysis. By using displacement typologies to guide where protections and investments are prioritized, Seattle can improve housing stability, reduce inequities across neighborhoods, and move toward a more balanced and equitable housing system.
