# Rent Stabilization Policies and Housing Affordability in Seattle

**Course:** SOC401

**Professor:** Professor Zack Almquist

**Student Name:** Yomna Zakaria

# Executive Summary

Seattle faces growing housing affordability pressures as rents continue to rise faster than incomes, increasing risks of housing instability and displacement for low-income renters. Using data from the City of Seattle and the Urban Displacement Project, this analysis examines how rental prices, income levels, and neighborhood displacement risks have shifted over the past decade. The findings show a persistent shortage of units affordable to households earning 0–30% AMI, while most new rental supply has disproportionately served moderate-income households. Spatial disparities are also pronounced: neighborhoods classified as “ongoing” or “advanced displacement” contain fewer affordable units, while higher-income areas have experienced greater growth in 50–80% AMI housing. Although detailed eviction data are limited, displacement typologies reveal clear and consistent patterns of vulnerability. Together, these findings suggest that affordability pressures are structurally concentrated across specific neighborhoods and that targeted policy interventions, including rent stabilization and affordable housing investment, are necessary to improve housing stability.
