# Rent Stabilization Policies and Housing Affordability in Seattle

**Course:** SOC401

**Professor:** Professor Zack Almquist

**Student Name:** Yomna Zakaria

# Executive Summary

Seattle faces growing housing affordability pressures as rent rises faster than incomes, increasing risks of instability and displacement for low-income renters. Using data from the City of Seattle and the Urban Displacement Project, this analysis examines how rental prices, income levels, and neighborhood displacement risks have shifted over the past decade. The findings show a persistent shortage of units affordable to households earning 0-30% AMI, while most new rental supply serves moderate-income households. Spatial disparities are also pronounced: neighborhoods classified as “ongoing” or “advanced displacement” contain fewer affordable units, while high-income areas have seen more growth in 50-80% AMI units. Although detailed eviction data are limited, displacement typologies reveal clear patterns of vulnerability. These trends suggest that affordability pressures are structurally concentrated and that targeted interventions are essential for improving housing stability.
