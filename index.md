# Housing Affordability in Seattle

**Course:** SOC401

**Professor:** Professor Zack Almquist

**Student Name:** Yomna Zakaria

# Abstract or executive summary

My project explores housing affordability trends in Seattle using open data from the City of Seattle and the Urban Displacement Project. I'm hoping to analyze how rental prices, income levels, and neighborhoods have changed over the past decade. My goal is to provide insights that can help local policymakers identify areas of growing unaffordability and prioritize affordable housing investments.
