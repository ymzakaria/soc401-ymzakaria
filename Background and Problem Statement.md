**Background and Problem Statement**

Housing affordability has become one of the most urgent issues in Seattle. Over the past decade, rental prices have continued to rise faster than household incomes, which has placed many renters at greater risk of housing instability, displacement, and financial strain. Data from the City of Seattle show a consistent shortage of units that are affordable to households earning 0 to 30 percent of Area Median Income (AMI). At the same time, most new rental construction has focused on units for households earning 50 to 80 percent AMI. This leaves the lowest-income renters facing the greatest pressures with fewer housing options and higher vulnerability.
This issue is even more significant when considering Seattle’s rapid population growth and strong labor market, both of which have increased demand for housing. The limited availability of publicly accessible eviction data makes it difficult for policymakers to understand the full scope of displacement. Because of this gap, my project uses displacement typologies from the Urban Displacement Project to evaluate neighborhood-level risks and highlight patterns of housing instability.



**Stakeholders**

Several key stakeholders shape this policy landscape. Renters, especially low-income households, are directly affected by rising costs and limited supply. Landlords and property owners often point to increases in operating and maintenance expenses and express concerns that policies such as rent stabilization could affect their ability to maintain units or invest in new housing. Local government agencies, including the Seattle Office of Housing, are responsible for weighing these competing interests while developing policy responses. Community organizations and housing advocates focus on tenant protections and preventing displacement in vulnerable neighborhoods. Developers and affordable housing providers work within the city’s regulatory framework to expand supply where possible.

Given these intersecting pressures, the core policy problem is understanding how affordability trends vary across Seattle neighborhoods and identifying which communities face the highest risks. A clearer understanding of rental affordability, income levels, and displacement patterns can help local policymakers determine where interventions are most needed and which strategies will be most effective in addressing the city’s ongoing housing crisis.
