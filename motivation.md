title: Background and Problem Statement
---

Housing affordability has become one of the most urgent policy challenges in Seattle. Over the past decade, rental prices have risen faster than household incomes, placing many renters at increased risk of housing instability, displacement, and financial strain. Data from the City of Seattle show a persistent shortage of units affordable to households earning 0 to 30 percent of Area Median Income (AMI). At the same time, most new rental construction has been concentrated in units serving households earning 50 to 80 percent AMI. This imbalance leaves the lowest-income renters with the fewest housing options and the greatest vulnerability.

These challenges are intensified by Seattle’s rapid population growth and strong labor market, which have further increased demand for housing. Compounding the problem, the limited availability of publicly accessible eviction data makes it difficult for policymakers to fully assess displacement patterns. To address this gap, this project draws on displacement typologies from the Urban Displacement Project to evaluate neighborhood-level risks and identify where housing instability is most concentrated across the city.

**Stakeholders**

Several key stakeholders shape Seattle’s housing policy landscape. Renters, particularly low-income households, are directly affected by rising rents and limited access to affordable housing. Landlords and property owners often point to increasing operating and maintenance costs and express concern that policies such as rent stabilization may affect their ability to maintain properties or invest in new housing. Local government agencies, including the Seattle Office of Housing, must balance these competing interests while designing and implementing policy responses. Community organizations and housing advocates emphasize tenant protections and the prevention of displacement in vulnerable neighborhoods, while developers and affordable housing providers operate within the city’s regulatory framework to expand housing supply where feasible.

Given these intersecting pressures, the core policy problem lies in understanding how affordability trends and displacement risks vary across Seattle neighborhoods. Identifying which communities face the greatest vulnerability can help policymakers target interventions more effectively and evaluate strategies that improve housing stability while addressing the city’s broader affordability crisis.
