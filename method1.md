This interactive map shows the variations across displacement typologies across the Seattle neighborhoods. This highlights the spatial clustering of affordability challenges. Showing that tracts classified as “Advanced Displacement” and “Ongoing Displacement” contain lower shares of affordable units, while “Stable High-Income” areas show concentrated growth in 50-80%AMI units. These spatial differences make it clear that affordability pressures are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods.
