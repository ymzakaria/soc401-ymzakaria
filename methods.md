**Seattle Map**

This interactive map shows the variations across displacement typologies across the Seattle neighborhoods. This highlights the spatial clustering of affordability challenges. Showing that tracts classified as “Advanced Displacement” and “Ongoing Displacement” contain lower shares of affordable units, while “Stable High-Income” areas show concentrated growth in 50-80%AMI units. These spatial differences make it clear that affordability pressures are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods.

**Rental Units by Affordability Category Over Time**

The time-series plots (Figures 1 and 9) demonstrate substantial disparities by income tier. Units affordable at 0-30% AMI saw a sharp decline after 2010, while those units at 50-80% AMI had a sustained growth, specifically after 2018. This widening gap indicated that new production is disproportionately serving moderate-income renters, therefore, leaving low-income households at a higher risk of housing instability. 

**Housing Affordability Metrics by Displacement Typology**

When looking at the number of units by the typology map, Table 3 shows that the largest number of tracts fall into the “stable moderate/mixed-income” category, suggesting a relative stability across a large part of Seattle. That being said, a substantial number of tracts remain in categories timed to vulnerability and displacement risk. 58 tracts are classified as “low-income/susceptible to displacement” indicating that a significant portion of the city faces pressure from gentrification.
