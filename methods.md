Showing that tracts classified as “Advanced Displacement” and “Ongoing Displacement” contain lower shares of affordable units, while “Stable High-Income” areas show concentrated growth in 50-80%AMI units. These spatial differences make it clear that affordability pressures are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods.
