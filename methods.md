**Spatial Patterns of Displacement Risk in Seattle (Map)**

<iframe src="/_includes/map.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

The interactive displacement typology map reveals clear spatial clustering of housing vulnerability across Seattle. Neighborhoods classified as “Low-Income/Susceptible to Displacement,” “Advanced Displacement,” or “Ongoing Displacement” are concentrated largely in central and south Seattle. These areas have historically housed lower-income communities and communities of color, and the map shows that they continue to face heightened vulnerability as redevelopment pressures increase. In contrast, neighborhoods in north Seattle are more likely to appear as “Stable High-Income” or “Stable Moderate/Mixed Income,” indicating lower displacement risk and relatively stable housing conditions.

What stands out in the map is the overlap between displacement risk and the limited supply of deeply affordable units. Many of the tracts at high risk have not seen growth in affordable housing, while more economically stable neighborhoods show greater increases in units affordable to moderate-income households. This spatial mismatch highlights the uneven distribution of affordability pressures across the city and underscores the structural nature of housing inequity in Seattle. Rather than being distributed randomly, displacement risk is geographically concentrated in neighborhoods already facing socioeconomic strain. 

**Housing Affordability Across Displacement Typologies**

Table 3 provides additional insight into how affordability intersects with displacement risk. The most common category is “Stable Moderate/Mixed Income,” with 178 tracts, suggesting broad areas of relative stability. However, the second-largest category is “Low-Income/Susceptible to Displacement,” encompassing 58 tracts across the city. This indicates that a significant number of neighborhoods face economic pressures that could lead to resident turnover, rising rents, and loss of community cohesion.

Several other categories signal ongoing or advanced forms of neighborhood change. For example, “Early/Ongoing Gentrification” and “Advanced Gentrification” together account for 25 tracts, highlighting areas where housing conditions and neighborhood demographics are rapidly shifting. The “At Risk of Becoming Exclusive” and “Becoming Exclusive” categories, representing 58 and 34 tracts respectively, illustrate the spatial expansion of higher-income enclaves, where rising costs are gradually reducing access for lower-income households.

When viewed alongside the map and rental unit trends, Table 3 reinforces a clear pattern: neighborhoods with the greatest affordability challenges often overlap with those facing the highest risk of displacement. This alignment suggests that affordability pressures are structural rather than incidental and that they disproportionately impact neighborhoods with long-standing socioeconomic vulnerability.

**Trends in Rental Units by Affordability Category Over Time**

The time-series visuals show long-term shifts in Seattle’s rental housing supply by affordability level. Units affordable to households earning 0–30% AMI remain consistently low throughout the study period and decline sharply after 2010. This drop is especially concerning because households in this income tier experience the highest rent burdens and have the fewest alternative housing options. The decline suggests that the production of deeply affordable units is not keeping pace with need, increasing the likelihood of displacement for extremely low-income renters.

In contrast, units affordable to households earning 50–80% AMI grow steadily over time, with significant acceleration beginning around 2018. The analysis indicates that this tier now represents the largest portion of new rental units being added to the market. While this growth may relieve pressure for moderate-income renters, it does not address the substantial unmet need among the lowest-income households. The widening gap between the production of deeply affordable units and moderate-income units demonstrates how the market is disproportionately serving middle-income renters and leaving lower-income households increasingly vulnerable.

This divergence between housing production and renter incomes is a key driver of displacement: as fewer units remain affordable to low-income households, the likelihood of being priced out of one’s neighborhood increases.

**Summary of Key Patterns**

Across all visualizations, a consistent story emerges. First, Seattle faces a chronic shortage of units affordable to households earning 0–30% AMI. Second, new rental development is concentrated in the 50–80% AMI tier, which does little to alleviate pressures on the lowest-income renters. Third, displacement risk is spatially concentrated in areas with limited affordable housing production, demonstrating that the city’s affordability crisis is geographically uneven and structurally embedded.

These findings highlight the importance of targeted policies aimed at stabilizing renters in vulnerable neighborhoods and expanding the supply of deeply affordable units. Without interventions that address these disparities, Seattle’s housing market will continue to reinforce inequities in who can afford to live and remain in the city.
